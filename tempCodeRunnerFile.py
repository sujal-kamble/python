# #membership operators
# fruits = [ "apple", "mango", "cherry", "banana"]
# print( "banana" in fruits)

# #bitwise operators
# a = 2
# b = 3
# print( a & b)
# print( a | b)
# print( a ^ b) # gives bitwise XOR operation => for that it first converts decimal numbers to binary numbers 
#              #and by using XOR table gives output
# print( ~b)
# print( a << b)
